** INFO **
	Here you find some scripts to make profiling to queries that a Blog in Elgg do.
	I did it becuase I was thinking some aproachs to develop a multilingual Elgg 
	changing the model of it. But finally I use other way of development, following 
	some recomendations from Cash Costello.
	I put them here, because could be usefull to somebody that want to make profiling 
	of Elgg queries.

** DIFFERENT TESTS **
	blog.php:
		Is a test that make the same queries as elgg to create a blog post.

	blogADDCOL.php:
		Test that generates 1000 queries creating a blog post using the strategy of adding a column in objects_entity for every language.

	blogADDROW1b1l.php:
		Test that generates 1000 blogs with 1000 languages, 1 blog 1 language.
		Using two tables for that, elgg_objects_entity modified and elgg_translations.

	blogADDROW1b1000l.php:
		Test that generates 1 blog with 1000 different languages.
		Using the same tables as blogADDROW1b1l.php.
		

** VIEWING RESULTS **

	In data folder there are graphs of every test 
	and their own data files.

** EXECUTION **

	You need to have an elgg database, one for every test will be the best solution.
	Put the name of the database in every script.
	
	Execute a one script at a time as:
		php5 blog.php
	
	The data will be saved in dataFull file.

	Create the graph with:
	
		gnuplot script
		
		In order to get a proper graph you should change the title
		and yrange parameters.

** TODO **
	- Create a library to avoid repeat the same code in every script.
